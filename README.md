# Primeflix
Prime Flix is a clone attempt of major streaming websites.
The websites describes basic CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations.
A user has to create an account through which he/she can browse through the movies database, search by title, director, actors, genres and maintain a list of favourites.
If logged in using the admin credentials, the admin page is displayed from which the admin can add/edit/delete the titles of movies.
The admin can also view basic statistics which are populated using stored procedures and triggers in the database.


An AMP(Apache, MySQL, php) stack website.
This mini project was a part of our curriculum for third year engineering for DBMS(Database Management Systems).
